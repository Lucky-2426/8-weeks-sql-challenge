# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

This repository contains my personal solutions for the case studies in **[8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**.
The 8 Week SQL Challenge is started by Danny Ma through Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program, which consists of 8 different SQL challenges.

Each case-study folder always contains the following files : 
- A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
- 1 SQL file to create the schema, tables and loading data.
- SQL files with respective challenge questions in MySQL.
- MD files which contains MySQL queries with explanation & snapshots of output of the queries.

**Note**: 
- Solutions are coded in **MySQL**
