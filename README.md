# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

This repository contains my personal solutions for the case studies in **[8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**.
The 8 Week SQL Challenge is started by Danny Ma through Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program, which consists of 8 different SQL challenges.

Each case-study folder contains the following folders :
- SQL codes : where solutions are coded in raw MySQL
- SQL codes explained where you will find md files with snapshots of the solutions explained in details per step


Each case-study folder alwayscontains the following files : 
- A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
- SQL file to create the schema, tables and loading data
- MD files which contains SQL queries answering the respective challenge questions

**Note**: 
- Solutions are coded in **MySQL**
